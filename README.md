Predicting housing prices for homes in Northern Virginia area using data scaped from Zillow.com
```
## 🤔 Background
Currently in the market for my first home, I decided I needed to do my research of the Northern Virginia (NoVA) housing market to supplement the info I've been gathering in my in-person search.
But beyond performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the prices and attributes of homes in 16 different suburbs of NoVA, I wanted to create a model to predict housing prices--namely through the use of various regression models.

Predicting housing prices for homes in Northern Virginia area using data scaped from Zillow.com
```
## 🔍 Background
Currently in the market for my first home, I decided I needed to do my research on the Northern Virginia (NoVA) housing market to supplement the info I've been gathering on my in-person search.

But beyond performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the prices and attributes of homes in 16 different suburbs of NoVA, I wanted to create a model to predict housing prices--namely through the use of various regression models.

## 🔢 Data
The 143 properties' data was scraped from Zillow using [webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/), which allowed me to use a point-and-click interface to gather various facts from each listing.
